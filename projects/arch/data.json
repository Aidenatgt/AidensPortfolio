  "long": "Windows really ticks me off. I had been using linux for a while and was comfortable with it. Then I was about to take an operating systems class and figured that installing Arch would help prepare me as well as help me better customize my laptop to my needs. I don't know if I did any better in the class because of it but I absolutely learned a whole lot. I had to start by partitioning the drive, formatting the partitions, and installing Arch into one of them. Then I configured all of the device's settings such as the locale and system time. Finally I installed a bootloader. Then I had software on my laptop, but it was just a terminal and it couldn't do things like play sound or show images. From that point I spent countless hours over a long time installing packages and configuring them to my liking. I use Hyprland as my compositor and have been enjoying it greatly. Instead of using a desktop environment like GNOME, I put all the parts together myself so I would know how everything works and could choose not to install anything I didn't need. I chose not to use a desktop manager and instead start Hyprland with a command when I boot up the machine, and that way I can also just use the terminal without any desktop. If I need every last bit of power I can just use the laptop headless. This doesn't seem to be an issue though; where I'm at now, my laptop usually sits at 0.5% CPU usage when I'm not doing anything. So building my own Arch system definitely cut out a lot of the overhead processing."
