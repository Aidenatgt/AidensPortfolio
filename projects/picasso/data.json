  "long": "I'm going to be real with this one: I needed a wallpaper for my computer and I just went way overboard with it. I thought it would be cool if it was ASCII, and I wanted it to be an Auburn thing because war eagle, but I didn't find something I liked within 10 seconds of searching for that on Google Images. So the logical next step was to make a program to take a picture, convert it to ASCII art, and paste it on top of a background image. I know there is absolutely something that already does this, but I didn't even look for it because I just wanted to do it myself. As you can see from the supplied image, it turned out pretty well. I've done a lot of things that are more impressive than this which aren't making it into this portfolio, but this thing looks cool and I like it."
